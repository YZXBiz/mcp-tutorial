## Introduction

Imagine you only know English. To get info from a person who only knows:

French, you must learn French.
German, you must learn German.
And so on.

In this setup, learning even 5 languages will be a nightmare for you!

But what if you add a translator that understands all languages?

You talk to the translator.
It infers the info you want.
It picks the person to talk to.
It gets you a response.

This is simple, isn't it?

The translator is like an MCP!

It lets you (Agents) talk to other people (tools or other capabilities) through a single interface.

To formalize, while LLMs possess impressive knowledge and reasoning skills, which allow them to perform many complex tasks, their knowledge is limited to their initial training data.

If they need to access real-time information, they must use external tools and resources on their own, which tells us how important tool calling is to LLMs if we need reliable inputs every time.

MCP acts as a universal connector for AI systems to capabilities (tools, etc.), similar to how USB-C standardizes connections between electronic devices.

It provides a secure, standardized way for AI models to communicate with external data sources and tools.

We are starting this MCP crash course to provide you with a thorough explanation and practical guide to MCPs, covering both the theory and the application.

Just as the RAG crash course and AI Agents crash course, each chapter will clearly explain MCP concepts, provide real-world examples, diagrams, and implementations, and practical lab assignments and projects.

As we progress, we will see how MCP dynamically supplies AI systems with relevant context, significantly enhancing their adaptability and utility.

By the end, you will fully understand:

- What MCP is and why it's essential
- How MCP enhances context-awareness in AI systems
- How to use MCP to dynamically provide AI systems with the necessary context
- How to connect models to tools and other capabilities via MCP
- How to build your own modular AI workflows using MCP

In this part, we shall focus on laying the foundation by exploring what context means in the realm of LLMs, why traditional prompt engineering and context-management techniques fall short, and how MCP emerges as a robust solution to these limitations.

> **Prerequisites:** We assume that you have at least basic programming knowledge in Python and a high-level understanding of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs).

Let's begin!

## What You'll Learn

This comprehensive crash course is divided into multiple parts:

- **Part A:** Background, foundations, and architecture
- **Part B:** Capabilities, protocols, and implementation details
- **Part C:** Building custom MCP clients from scratch

Each part builds upon the previous one, providing both theoretical understanding and practical implementation experience.
